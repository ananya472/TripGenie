# TripGenie

This project is an AI-based travel planning application that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences. Users input their destination, budget, travel duration, interests, dietary preferences, and accommodation type, and the AI suggests a detailed daily itinerary. The app was initially built using Ollama's Llama 3 model, but due to deployment issues on Streamlit Cloud, it now uses a cloud-based AI model for seamless functionality.
